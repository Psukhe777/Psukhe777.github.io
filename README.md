# 🏛️ Babylon Technologies: The 60-Day Venture Sprint

> **"Building the Future in Public. No Fluff. Just Code."**

I am a **Data Scientist and Founder** executing an elite **Venture Sprint**: building, shipping, and monetizing **6 production-grade AI products in 60 days**. We don't just build apps; we build a central intelligence engine and deploy industry facades to prove that velocity and craft belong to the individual builder.

### 🧠 Core Philosophy: The Babylon Way

* **Velocity is the Only Metric:** In the AI era, shipping slow is the only terminal risk.
* **From Rock Bottom to Production:** Every line of code is fueled by the resilience of a journey from homelessness to Data Science.
* **Proprietary Data Moats:** Every "No" from a patient or "Red Flag" in a contract is logged to train our next generation of specialized models.
